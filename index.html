            This is a project to create self-graphing algorithms in Javascript
            using the HTML5 "canvas" element. The reason this will be useful 
            for pedagogical purposes is that the user of the library can
            closely duplicate algorithms from course material (in our
            case, we will be using the famous CLRS <i>Algorithms</i> book)
            and animate those algorithms. The existing tools we have found
            available come with built in animated data structures, which 
            is fine as far as it goes, but does not allow the educator
            to create the data structures themselves, from the bottom
            up.

            The name of the project is in honor of the tiny 
            Welsh coal-mining town of Algocynfas, where Prof.
            Callahan and his friend Anas met, while working 18-hour shifts
            extracting black diamond from the rocky Welsh hills.
